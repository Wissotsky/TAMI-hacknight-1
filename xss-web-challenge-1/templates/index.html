    <h1 id="preventing-cross-site-scripting-xss-attacks">Preventing
        Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks</h1>
        <p>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a common and potentially
        dangerous type of cyber attack that involves injecting malicious code
        into a webpage. These attacks can be used to steal sensitive
        information, such as login credentials or financial data, or to
        manipulate the appearance or functionality of a webpage. As a website
        owner or developer, it is important to understand how to prevent and
        defend against XSS attacks.</p>
        <h2 id="steps-to-prevent-xss-attacks">Steps to prevent XSS attacks</h2>
        <ol type="1">
        <li><p>Sanitize user input: XSS attacks often involve injecting
        malicious code into input fields, such as search boxes, login forms, and
        comment boxes. One way to prevent these attacks is to sanitize user
        input by stripping out potentially harmful characters or tags. This can
        be done on the server side, before the input is stored or displayed on
        the webpage.</p></li>
        <li><p>Use content security policies (CSPs): CSPs are a set of rules
        that define which sources are allowed to load content on a webpage. By
        defining a CSP, you can prevent malicious code from being executed on
        your webpage.</p></li>
        <li><p>Keep your software and plugins up to date: Outdated software and
        plugins can be vulnerable to XSS attacks, so it is important to keep all
        of your software and plugins up to date. This includes your web server
        software, your content management system (CMS), and any other software
        or plugins you are using.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>By following these steps, you can help protect your website and its
        users from XSS attacks. It is important to take these precautions
        seriously, as XSS attacks can have serious consequences for both your
        website and its users.</p>
